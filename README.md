# Rizzo

Powered by starky and [plonky2](https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/plonky2), Rizzo borrows heavily from the design and implementation of [0xPolygonZero/zk\_evm](https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/zk_evm).

## Work in Progress

Rizzo is in the very early stages of development.

## Usage

Building currently requires the `nightly` Rust toolchain.
